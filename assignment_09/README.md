### Dependencies üì¶

Before running this projects, you must install these dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install make \ 
                gcc \
                build-essential \
                autotools-dev \
                autoconf \
                libtool
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **In order to use the library, you first need to install the driver on the device. You can refer to the lab manual in section 3 and use the source code found in the timer-mod directory.**

### Build library üóÉ

In this section we will use make, as part of autotools, for driver compilation.

#### Using tar.gz file
First, we need to extract the content of the `libstdmath-1.0.tar.gz` file:

```sh
tar -xvf libstdmath-1.0.tar.gz
```

Then, move to the `libtime_turner-1.0/` directory and create 2 directories:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
mkdir usr
../configure --prefix=<path-to-your-usr-directory>
```

If you want to install the library permanently in your computer don't use the `--prefix` command flag.

Inside `build` directory run the follow commands:

```sh
make
make install
cd usr
ls
```

### Cloning repository

If you downloaded the repository and will be using the source code, just change to `libtime_turner/` directory an run:

```bash
sh install.sh
```

This commands will build the program, and also generates an application package with all the necessary files for distribution to the user.

# Assignment 08

## Drivers in Linux

***

This assignment presents a brief introduction to drivers in linux. In this tutorial we'll create a driver for memory management, using the Linux standards for initiate, open, release, read, write and finish device controllers.

For a better comprehension of this assignment, you can check the instruction manual and the linux official documentation.

### Dependencies ðŸ“¦

Before running this projects, you must install these dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install make \ 
                gcc \
                build-essential \
                linux-headers-$(uname -r)
```

### Build library ðŸ—ƒ

In this section we will use `make`, as part of `autotools`, for driver compilation.

First, clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ce-box/CE5303-embedded-systems-studio
cd assignment_08
```

Each directory brings an script to compile and run the program:

```sh
bash run.sh
```

or

```sh
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```

The output of the memory driver's test must be like those:

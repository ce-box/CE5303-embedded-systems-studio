## Make

***

### Dependencies ðŸ“¦

Before running this projects, you must install these dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install make \ 
                gcc \
                build-essential \
```

### Build library ðŸ—ƒ

In this section we will use the `make` command to compile our programs. To compile the programs run:

```bash
make
```

The library has the following structure:

```text
stdmath
    |
    |-- bin
    |-- include
    |    |-- stdmath.h
    |
    |-- lib
    |    |-- stdmath.c
    |    |-- Makefile
    |
    |-- src
    |    |-- main.c
    |    |-- Makefile   
    |
    |-- Makefile
```

### Run the program ðŸš€

The program generates two executable files: one that uses the static library and one that uses the shared library.

```bash
cd bin
./calculator_d
./calculator_s
```
